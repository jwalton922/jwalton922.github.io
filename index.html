        <p>I have had an idea for a game for awhile. The idea is rather ambitious and will probably never reach complete fruition, but I thought I could maybe help other potential game developers</p>
        <p>Here are a list of projects that might be useful for a fledgling game developer</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3 href="http://jwalton922.github.io/craftyjsAndReinerTilesets/"><a>Free Game Art</a></h3>
                <p><a href="http://craftyjs.com/">Craftyjs</a> is a lightweight javascript game engine. <a href="http://www.reinerstilesets.de/">Reiner's Tilesets</a> is a great resource for game development. Reiner has graciously provided a lot of <a href="http://www.reinerstilesets.de/lizenz/">free</a> 2D and now 3D game art.</p>
                <p>This project contains some utilities to merge Reiner's 2D art, make them transparent, and how to create animations with them in Crafty.js</p></li>
